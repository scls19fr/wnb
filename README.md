# Weight and balance (wnb)

Calculate weight and balance of aircraft

This is currently a work in progress...

It's not usable.

Just a sample project to try JS with Quasar Framework, unit tests with Jest, ...

Please use data at your own risk.

The use of an application does not prevent the need to know how to do the calculation by yourself.
